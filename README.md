# NBA Insider
The NBA Insider web application was developed with the primary goal of providing basketball enthusiasts, coaches, and team executives with a comprehensive platform to explore and analyze NBA statistics and data, while offering a user-friendly and interactive interface. The target problem we aimed to solve was the lack of an accessible and all-encompassing tool that presents relevant NBA data and insights to fans or professionals within the sport. With NBA Insider, users can easily access valuable information about players, teams, and the financial aspects of the league, empowering them to make informed decisions and improve their strategies.
